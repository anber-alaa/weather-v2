1. **City Search**:  
   Users can enter any city name, and the app fetches its current weather using WeatherAPI.

2. **Geolocation**:  
   If the user allows location access, the app fetches weather data for their current position using the **Geolocation API**.

3. **Display**:  
   Weather details (temperature, condition, humidity, wind speed, etc.) are shown in stylish, responsive cards.
